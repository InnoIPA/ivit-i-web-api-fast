# Integrate streaming with iVIT-I
iVIT-I support WebRTC and MSE streaming to integration.

## WebRTC [ðŸ”—](./webrtc/README.md) 
*** Network Required ***

WebRTC is a technology that enables real-time communication directly in the web browser without the need for additional plugins or applications. It supports video, audio, and data transfer. Key features include peer-to-peer connections for direct communication, low latency, and the ability to work across different platforms and devices. WebRTC is widely used for applications like video conferencing, live streaming, and peer-to-peer file sharing.

## MSE [ðŸ”—](./mse/README.md)
*** No Need Network ***

MSE is a web API that allows for more complex and controlled video playback in web browsers. It enables the manipulation of media streams (audio or video) directly in JavaScript, allowing for dynamic changes to the content being played, such as adjusting quality levels or implementing custom buffering strategies. This technology is essential for video streaming services that require adaptive bitrate streaming, like Netflix or YouTube, to ensure smooth playback and efficient use of bandwidth.
